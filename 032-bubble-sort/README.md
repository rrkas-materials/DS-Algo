# Bubble Sort

1. Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements.
2. If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped.
3. Now, compare the second and the third elements. Swap them if they are not in order.
4. The above process goes on until the last element.

## Bubble Sort Complexity


| **Time Complexity** |   |
| - | - |
| Best | O(n) |
| Worst | O(n^2^) |
| Average | O(n^2^) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(1) |
| **Stability** | Yes |

### Complexity in Detail

Bubble Sort compares the adjacent elements.


| Cycle | Number of Comparisons |
| - | - |
| 1st | (n-1) |
| 2nd | (n-2) |
| 3rd | (n-3) |
| ....... | ...... |
| last | 1 |



## Applications

Bubble sort is used if

* complexity does not matter
* short and simple code is preferred
