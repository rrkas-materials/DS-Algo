# Graph

A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.

A graph is a data structure (V, E) that consists of

* A collection of vertices V
* A collection of edges E, represented as ordered pairs of vertices (u,v)

## Graph Terminology

* **Adjacency**: A vertex is said to be adjacent to another vertex if there is an edge connecting them. Vertices 2 and 3 are not adjacent because there is no edge between them.
* **Path**: A sequence of edges that allows you to go from vertex A to vertex B is called a path. 0-1, 1-2 and 0-2 are paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2.
* **Directed Graph**: A graph in which an edge (u,v) doesn't necessarily mean that there is an edge (v, u) as well. The edges in such a graph are represented by arrows to show the direction of the edge.

## Graph Representation

### 1. Adjacency Matrix

* An adjacency matrix is a 2D array of V x V vertices. Each row and column represent a vertex.
* If the value of any element `a[i][j]` is 1, it represents that there is an edge connecting vertex i and vertex j.
* Edge lookup(checking if an edge exists between vertex A and vertex B) is extremely fast in adjacency matrix representation but we have to reserve space for every possible link between all vertices(V x V), so it requires more space.

### 2. Adjacency List

* An adjacency list represents a graph as an array of linked lists.
* The index of the array represents a vertex and each element in its linked list represents the other vertices that form an edge with the vertex.
* An adjacency list is efficient in terms of storage because we only need to store the values for the edges. For a graph with millions of vertices, this can mean a lot of saved space.

## Operations

* Check if the element is present in the graph
* Graph Traversal
* Add elements(vertex, edges) to graph
* Finding the path from one vertex to another
