# Spanning Tree

* A spanning tree is a sub-graph of an undirected connected graph, which includes all the vertices of the graph with a minimum possible number of edges. If a vertex is missed, then it is not a spanning tree.
* The edges may or may not have weights assigned to them.

## Properties

* The total number of spanning trees with `n` vertices that can be created from a complete graph is equal to `n<sup>(n-2)</sup>`.

## Minimum Spanning Tree

A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree in which the sum of the weight of the edges is as minimum as possible.

## Spanning Tree Applications

* Computer Network Routing Protocol
* Cluster Analysis
* Civil Network Planning
