# Tree

## Terminologies

* **Node**
  * A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.
  * The last nodes of each path are called **leaf nodes or external nodes** that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes.
  * The node having at least a child node is called an **internal node**.
* **Edge**
  * It is the link between any two nodes.
* **Root**
  * It is the topmost node of a tree.
* **Height of Node**
  * The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf (ie. the longest path from the node to a leaf node).
* **Depth of a Node**
  * The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.
* **Height of a Tree**
  * The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.
* **Degree of a Node**
  * The degree of a node is the total number of branches of that node.
* **Forest**
  * A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest.

## Types of trees

* Binary Tree
* Binary Search tree
* AVL Tree
* B-Tree *or* B tree
* B+ Tree
* Red-Black Tree

## Operations

* Insert Node
* delete node
* traverse: visiting each node
  * inorder traversal

    * First, visit all the nodes in the left subtree
    * Then the root node
    * Visit all the nodes in the right subtree
  * preorder traversal

    * Visit root node
    * Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
    * Visit all the nodes in the right subtree
  * postorder traversal

    * Visit all the nodes in the left subtree
    * Visit all the nodes in the right subtree
    * Visit the root node

## Applications

* Binary Search Trees(BSTs) are used to quickly check whether an element is present in a set or not.
* Heap is a kind of tree that is used for heap sort.
* A modified version of a tree called Tries is used in modern routers to store routing information.
* Most popular databases use B-Trees and T-Trees, which are variants of the tree structure we learned above to store their data
* Compilers use a syntax tree to validate the syntax of every program you write.
